Here is a list of frequently asked questions I've put together based on
feedback from the Xoptfoil thread on RCGroups:

The questions are just listed directly below for reference.  The full questions/
answers are below that.

1) On Windows, When I double-click the Xoptfoil executable to run it, a window 
   pops up but then closes right away.  What should I do?
2) What's the difference between min-drag, min-sink, and max-lift?
3) My output airfoils look wavy or bumpy.  What can I do?
4) What if my seed airfoil doesn't pass all the constraints?
5) What are all the different output files for?
6) Can I stop an optimization that's taking a long time and restart it later?
7) How do I plot the results?
8) How do shape functions work?
9) How does flap optimization work?
10) What's the difference between Hicks-Henne and NACA shape functions?
11) What's the difference between particle swarm and genetic algorithm?
12) How do I optimize for high lift?
13) What if most of the initial designs can't be initialized in the feasible
    space?
14) Why do some outputs show so many digits after the decimal point?

   It probably means that there is an error in your input file, or maybe one of 
   the required input files is not present.  You should run Xoptfoil from the 
   command prompt, which will prevent the window from closing, so you'll be able
   to see the what the error was.  You can find instructions for how to run it 
   from the command prompt in the user guide (see Section 2: Running Xoptfoil).
